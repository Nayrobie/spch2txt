**AI Rollout Update**
- Beta release is on track for next Monday.
- Data pipeline refactor completed, reducing inference latency by around 30 percent.

**Infrastructure**
- A migration from GPU cluster on Azure to on-premise inference nodes is being prepared, pending readiness of the monitoring stack.

**Logging and Model Drift Detection**
- The new tracking agent is not yet integrated, but hooks are in place.
- Aiming to finalize event schema for the observability layer by the end of the week to demo drift dashboard during Monday's stakeholder sync.

**Audio Preprocessing**
- Found that Whisper's transcription quality improves with dynamic input gain normalization.
- Plan to extend this preprocessing step across all audio channels to aid in hybrid meeting recordings.
- This addition will be made to the `audio.utils` module, with a new branch to be pushed later in the day.

**Summarization Testing**
- Plan to commence testing of LLM integration in the next sprint with GPT-4o-mini for cloud inference and local evaluation of Mistral.
- This will facilitate generation of summaries and action items from transcripts such as this one.
- The workflow will be documented in the README and tagged as a Milestone 3 deliverable, with a test transcript included for validation purpose before merging.
